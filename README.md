# TelegramCopier
Telegram users scraper from a group to another group.

# What is this?
That's an automated program that gets an user list from any of telegram group or megagroup then adds these users to another group.

# What's difference between any other bots?
TelegramCopier includes multithreading, proxy support and forcing sms authentication. You can start as much bot as you have accounts at json files.

# How can i setup my own proxy and which type of proxies are usable?
TelegramCopier has a full support on Socks5. You can set-up your own proxy server on ubuntu. Check google with 'setting up socks server on ubuntu'

# What's the rate of adding users to another group?
Unlimited. But generally an account can add 30-80 users daily. So you have to more than 30 accounts to add up to 1k users.

# Channels can be used?
No. Only groups and megagroups(groups that have a t.me/xxxx link)

# Will software be updated?
Surely if i get some donate to improve :)
